I’ve been a software engineer for the past 15 years, but my fascination with programming started much earlier. As a kid, I wrote little games in BASIC on the green-glow terminal of an IBM PC. That early spark set me on a path to spend my career exploring how software can shape the way we work and live.

Most of my professional journey has been in web development. I’m comfortable across the full stack — building rich UIs with React and TypeScript, designing data layers with GraphQL, or scaling backend services in Go. Whether it’s refining a dark theme in Tailwind or tackling a thorny distributed systems challenge, I enjoy working across layers to make ideas real.

These days, my interest has shifted toward native development in Swift and Rust. I’m especially excited about building productivity tools that weave in AI to help humans work smarter and with more flow.

I’m always looking for opportunities to create something fun, useful, or meaningful. If you have a project or problem you’d like to explore, I’d love to hear about it.
