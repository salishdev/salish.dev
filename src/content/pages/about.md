I've been working as a software engineer for the past 15 years. But I got started programming much earlier. As a kid I learned enough BASIC to write little games on the green terminal of an IBM 5150. That was a long time ago, but that early fascination has driven me to devote my career to understanding and harnessing the power of software.

I have been developing for the web for most of my career. I'm proficient with all the latest web tech (last I checked). React, Typescript, GraphQL, some Golang. I'm comfortable with the full stack. I can hack on a dark theme with Tailwind CSS or <some difficult distributed systems cloud scaling task>.

These days I'm mostly interested in native development and AI applications. In that regard, I'm writing a lot of Swift and Rust.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to build something fun, beautiful, useful, or profound. If you have a project, or problem in mind, I'd love to hear about it.
