I've been working as a software engineer for the past 15 years. But I got started programming much earlier. As a kid I learned enough BASIC to write silly games on the green terminal of an IBM 5150. That was a long time ago, but that early fascination has driven me to devote my career to understanding and harnessing the power of software.

These days, I mostly use React, Typescript, and Node.js. This is often alongside a fullstack framework such as Next.js, RedwoodJS, or Remix. I have an eye for detail and I can create CSS that matches your Figma designs to the pixel.

My passion for developing with Swift and SwiftUI has led me to create innovative iOS and macOS applications. Over the years, I've had the pleasure of building a diverse array of apps, both for clients and for my own company, Astere Software. Many of these applications have successfully made their way to the App Store, where they have been well-received by users. My work reflects a commitment to quality and a deep understanding of user experience, ensuring that each app not only meets but exceeds expectations.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to build something useful, interesting or beautiful. If you have a project, or problem in mind, I'd love to hear about it.
